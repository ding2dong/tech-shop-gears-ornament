￼Hack it!
NOTE: Make sure the gear is fully charged before starting any hacking,
and keep in mind that the on-board battery powers the circuit during
programming.
Download the current version of MPLAB IDE:
http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg
?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId= 1406&dDocName=en019469
Download the gear source code from:
http://bethschechter.com/GearSpin_16F 1823.zip
Open the MPLAB IDE and select File > Open Workspace. Select Gearspin
from the .zip file mentioned above.
The PIC we are programming is the 16F1823. You need to choose Config-
ure > Select Device from the menu inMPLAB IDE. Select “16F1823” from
the device option in the upper left hand corner of that window.
A Voltage Caution Error window will appear. Hit OK.
You can change the programming code by selecting the "main.c" file in
the Gearspin.mcw window.
Select Project > Build to compile the code.
Make sure the switch on the actual gear is set to on, the switch will
be set towards the PIC chip. Reference
picture <3> to see this.
Place the end of the TAG-CONNECT cable into the programming port as
specified in picture <3>. Keep it at a 90 degree angle and pushed all
the into the board so the pins make contact.
Select Programmer > Program while holding the TAG-CONNECT cable into
the programming port.
The message Programming/Verify complete will appear when you are finished.
